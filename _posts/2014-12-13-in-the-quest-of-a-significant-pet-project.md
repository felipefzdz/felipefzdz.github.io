There are so many cool ways of keeping yourself up to date in programming business. Learning by doing is one of the approaches and maintaining a pet project is one of the strongest.

When starting a pet project you have to ask yourself what you want to mainly achieve.

*   Solving a problem (hopefully a real problem, something that you miss and nobody has implemented a proper solution yet)
*   Coping with a rough domain. Moving from CRUD to for instance a web crawler, a parser or some DSL tool.
*   Learning a new language. And remember:

*   Constraining yourself using some techniques in a disciplined and reflective way. Follow TDD, DDD, FP or whatever, but do it as the pet project purpose.&nbsp;

The pet project that I'm going to dissect in following posts will mainly focus in last point. It will address a simple domain, will be written in my native programming language, Java, and won't try to solve a real problem at all.

I got the spec from&nbsp;[here](https://github.com/TheLadders/object-calisthenics#exercise). As you can see the guys from The Ladders propose that as exercise for practising [Object Calisthenics](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf). We'll talk further about OOP and Clean Code in the future.
